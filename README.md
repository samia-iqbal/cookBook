# Cook Book App
### Abstract
The cook book will include different type of recipes. The users will be able to interact with the cook book app through CRUD functionalities such as add, read, update and delete recipes on the cook book app. The app is mainly designed to allow different types of users to view various types of recipes, allowing them to use the recipes available on cook book to enhance their both cooking and learning techniques. This app can be used by anyone whether they just want to view recipes for their cooking or to help others by adding in recipes to the app. The cook book app may also allow the users to leave a review for a recipe. This project will follow an agile methodology, followed by diagrams, risk assessement carried out and requirements that will be gathered to execute the interactive cook book app. Lastly, unit testing and continous integration will also be performed which will confirm if the app is ready to deploy for the users.

### Use Case diagram 
Below is the the use case diagram which demonstrates how the user will be interacting with the system which in this case is the Cook Book App (Please note that for implementation, I will only be interacting with two database tables which are recipes and reviews).

### Entity diagram 
Below is the Chen's conceptual model for the CookBook App. The diagram consists of entity types which in this case are Recipes, Users and Reviews, it also consists of relationships which are manages and contains. The user will manage recipes which in further detail means that the user can add/delete/update/review recipes. For the following entity types, there are different types of attributes such as primary key, foreign key and other attributes. The attributes in yellow are the primary key and the attributes in pink are the foreign key, which essentially means that this attribute was inherited from another table.
